		<h4><b>Question 1: </b></h4>
	

	<p><b>Each computer has a built-in instruction set that it knows how to execute by design.</b></p>
	
	
	 <form>
 
    <div class="alert alert-info">
  	Recall that we use the term computation to mean "the execution of a sequence of instructions by a computer with the intention of solving a given program".
		</div>
  
</form> 

		<form action = "">
		<input type = "radio" name = "Abijith"> True <br>
		<input type = "radio" name = "Abijith"> False <br>
		
	
	<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible">
    	<a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
    	<strong>Incorrect!</strong> Each computer has a set of primitives instructions that is "wired" to execute. We call this the instructions set of the computer.
  	</div>
	

		<h4><b>Question 2: </b></h4>

	

		<p><b>The computer uses intelligence to execute instructions.</b></p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
  	Recall that we said a computer executes the instructions given to it mechanically.
		</div>		
  
	

		<form action = "">
		<input type = "radio" name = "Hebbar"> True <br>
		<input type = "radio" name = "Hebbar"> False <br>
	
	<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible">
    <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
    <strong>Correct!</strong> A computer exectues instructions automatically. Its main task is to simply execute the instructions given to it(from its instructions set) and remember their result as the computation goes on. The part that may require intelligence is expressing a computation in terms of those instructions.
